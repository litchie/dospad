[sdl]
#       fullscreen: Start dosbox directly in fullscreen. (Press ALT-Enter to go back)
#       fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox.
#   fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                     Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                     If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
# windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                     (output=surface does not!)
#           output: What video system to use for output.
#                   Possible values: surface, overlay, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, ddraw, direct3d.
#         autolock: Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
#      sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity.
#      waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if dosbox has an error.
#         priority: Priority levels for dosbox. Second entry behind the comma is for when dosbox is not focused/minimized.
#                     pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                   Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#       mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the default value.
#      pixelshader: Pixelshader program (effect file must be in Shaders subdirectory). If 'forced' is appended,
#                   then the shader will be used even if the result might not be desired.
#     usescancodes: Avoid usage of symkeys, might not work on all operating systems.
#         overscan: Width of overscan border (0 to 10). (works only if output=surface)

#                                                    NOTE: if you disable the 14 & 16 pixel high font AND the second half when machine=cga, you will disable video bios completely.
#                                         forcerate: Force the VGA framerate to a specific value(ntsc, pal, or specific hz), no matter what
#                                     sierra ramdac: Whether or not to emulate a Sierra or compatible RAMDAC at port 3C6h-3C9h.
#                                                    Some DOS games expect to access port 3C6h to enable highcolor/truecolor SVGA modes on older chipsets.
#                                                    Disable if you wish to emulate SVGA hardware that lacks a RAMDAC or (depending on the chipset) does
#                                                    not emulate a RAMDAC that is accessible through port 3C6h. This option has no effect for non-VGA video hardware.
#                            sierra ramdac lock 565: When emulating High Sierra highcolor RAMDAC, assume 5:6:5 at all times if set. Else,
#                                                    bit 6 of the DAC command selects between 5:5:5 and 5:6:5. Set this option for demos or
#                                                    games that got the command byte wrong (MFX Transgrassion 2) or any other demo that is
#                                                    not rendering highcolor 16bpp correctly.
#                              page flip debug line: VGA debugging switch. If set, an inverse line will be drawn on the exact scanline that the CRTC display offset registers were written.
#                                                    This can be used to help diagnose whether or not the DOS game is page flipping properly according to vertical retrace if the display on-screen is flickering.
#                  vertical retrace poll debug line: VGA debugging switch. If set, an inverse green dotted line will be drawn on the exact scanline that the CRTC status port (0x3DA) was read.
#                                                    This can be used to help diagnose whether the DOS game is propertly waiting for vertical retrace.
#                                           cgasnow: When machine=cga, determines whether or not to emulate CGA snow
#                               allow port 92 reset: If set (default), allow the application to reset the CPU through port 92h
#                                    enable port 92: Emulate port 92h (PS/2 system control port A). If you want to emulate a system that predates the PS/2, set to 0.
#                         enable 1st dma controller: Emulate 1st (AT) DMA controller (default). Set to 0 if you wish to emulate a system that lacks DMA (PCjr and some Tandy systems)
#                         enable 2nd dma controller: Emulate 2nd (AT) DMA controller (default). Set to 0 if you wish to emulate a PC/XT system without 16-bit DMA.
#                                                    Note: mainline DOSBox automatically disables 16-bit DMA when machine=cga or machine=hercules, while DOSBox-X does not.
#                       allow dma address decrement: If set, allow increment & decrement modes as specified in the 8237 datasheet.
#                                                    If clear, always increment the address (as if to emulate clone 8237 implementations that skipped the inc/dec bit).
#                   enable dma extra page registers: If set, emulate the extra page registers (I/O ports 0x80, 0x84-0x86, 0x88, 0x8C-0x8E), like actual hardware.
#                                                    Note that mainline DOSBox behavior is to NOT emulate these registers.
#                     dma page registers write-only: Normally (on AT hardware) the DMA page registers are read/write. Set this option if you want to emulate PC/XT hardware where the page registers are write-only.
#                                  enable slave pic: Enable slave PIC (IRQ 8-15). Set this to 0 if you want to emulate a PC/XT type arrangement with IRQ 0-7 and no IRQ 2 cascade.
#                                enable pc nmi mask: Enable PC/XT style NMI mask register (0xA0). Note that this option conflicts with the secondary PIC and will be ignored if the slave PIC is enabled.
#                             rom bios 8x8 CGA font: If set, or mainline compatible bios mapping, a legacy 8x8 CGA font (first 128 characters) is stored at 0xF000:0xFA6E. DOS programs that do not use INT 10h to locate fonts might require that font to be located there.
#                    rom bios video parameter table: If set, or mainline compatible bios mapping, DOSBox will emulate the video parameter table and assign that to INT 1Dh. If clear, table will not be provided.
#                 allow more than 640kb base memory: If set, and space is available, allow conventional memory to extend past 640KB.
#                                                    For example, if machine=cga, conventional memory can extend out to 0xB800 and provide up to 736KB of RAM.
#                                                    This allows you to emulate PC/XT style memory extensions.
#                     vesa lfb base scanline adjust: If non-zero, the VESA BIOS will report the linear framebuffer as offset by this many scanlines.
#                                                    For example, if the LFB is at 0xC0000000 and you need the demo to draw 2 scan lines lower,
#                                                    at 0xC0000000 + (320*2) (320x240x256 mode), you would set this to 2. This option should be set
#                                                    to zero by default unless needed for certain DOS demos that have sloppy VESA linear framebuffer
#                                                    rendering code that renders a few scanlines UP into undefined memory preceeding the linear framebuffer.
#                                                    This option DOES NOT affect the visible offset of the linear framebuffer, it only affects the physical
#                                                    memory location reported by VESA BIOS emulation.
#                                allow hpel effects: If set, allow the DOS demo or program to change the horizontal pel (panning) register per scanline.
#                                                    Some early DOS demos use this to create waving or sinus effects on the picture. Not very many VGA
#                                                    chipsets allow this, so far, only ATI chipsets are known to support this effect. Disabled by default.
#                            allow hretrace effects: If set, allow the DOS demo or program to make the picture wavy by playing with the 'start horizontalretrace' register of the CRTC during the active picture. Some early DOS demos (Copper by Surprise!productions) need this option set for some demo effects to work. Disabled by default.
#                            hretrace effect weight: If emulating hretrace effects, this parameter adds 'weight' to the offset to smooth it out.
#                                                    the larger the number, the more averaging is applied. This is intended to emulate the inertia
#                                                    of the electron beam in a CRT monitor
#                      vesa vbe 1.2 modes are 32bpp: If set, truecolor (16M color) VESA BIOS modes in the 0x100-0x11F range are 32bpp. If clear, they are 24bpp.
#                                                    Some DOS games and demos assume one bit depth or the other and do not enumerate VESA BIOS modes, which is why this
#                                                    option exists.
#                   allow low resolution vesa modes: If set, allow low resolution VESA modes (320x200x16/24/32bpp and so on). You could set this to false to simulate
#                                                    SVGA hardware with a BIOS that does not support the lowres modes for testing purposes.
#                            allow 32bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 32bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                            allow 24bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 24bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                            allow 16bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 16bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                            allow 15bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 15bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                             allow 8bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 8bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                             allow 4bpp vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with 4bpp VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                              allow tty vesa modes: If the DOS game or demo has problems with text VESA modes, set to 'false'
#                           enable vga resize delay: If the DOS game you are running relies on certain VGA raster tricks that affect active display area, enable this option.
#                                                    This adds a delay between VGA mode changes and window updates. It also means that if you are capturing a demo or game,
#                                                    that your capture will also show a few garbled frames at any point mode changes occur, which is why this option is disabled
#                                                    by default. If you intend to run certain DOS games and demos like DoWhackaDo, enable this option.
#  resize only on vga active display width increase: If set, changes to the Display End register of the CRTC do not trigger DOSBox to resize it's window
#                                                    IF the value written is less than the current value. Some demos like DoWhackaDo need this option set
#                                                    because of the way it's raster effects work. If the DOSBox window rapidly changes size during a demo
#                                                    try setting this option. Else, leave it turned off. Changes to other VGA CRTC registers will trigger
#                                                    a DOSBox mode change as normal regardless of this setting.

#                              cycles: Amount of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate each millisecond.
#                                      Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
#                                      Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
#                                        'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
#                                                        It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
#                                        'fixed #number' will set a fixed amount of cycles. This is what you usually
#                                                        need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
#                                        'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
#                                                        handle.
#                                      Possible values: auto, fixed, max.
#                             cycleup: Amount of cycles to decrease/increase with keycombos.(CTRL-F11/CTRL-F12)
#                           cycledown: Setting it lower than 100 will be a percentage.
#            non-recursive page fault: Determines whether CPU emulation attempts to use a non-recursive method to emulate guest OS page fault exceptions.
#                                      If false (mainline DOSBox compatible), page faults are emulated using a recursive method, which is fine
#                                      for MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 emulation scenarios where the exception handler will always return directly to the fault location.
#                                      However, that assumption is not necessarily true for preemptive multitasking operating systems like Windows 95, for which
#                                      this setting should be enabled to help avoid recursion issues in DOSBox.

#                              oplmode: Type of OPL emulation. On 'auto' the mode is determined by sblaster type.
#                                       All OPL modes are Adlib-compatible, except for 'cms'. sbtype=none
#                                       together with oplmode=cms will emulate a Gameblaster.

# adlib force timer overflow on detect: If set, Adlib/OPL emulation will signal 'overflow' on timers after 50 I/O reads.
#                                       This is a temporary hack to work around timing bugs noted in DOSBox-X. Certain
#                                       games (Wolfenstein 3D) poll the Adlib status port a fixed number of times assuming
#                                       that the poll loop takes long enough for the Adlib timer to run out. If the game
#                                       cannot reliably detect Adlib at higher cycles counts, but can reliably detect at
#                                       lower cycles counts, set this option.
#                                       NOTE: Technically this decreases emulation accuracy, however it also reflects the
#                                             fact that DOSBox-X's I/O timing code needs some work to better match the
#                                             slowness of the ISA bus per I/O read in consideration of DOS games. So this
#                                             option is ON by default.
#                               oplemu: Provider for the OPL emulation. compat might provide better quality (see oplrate as well).
#                                       Possible values: default, compat, fast.
#                              oplrate: Sample rate of OPL music emulation. Use 49716 for highest quality (set the mixer rate accordingly).
#                                       Possible values: 44100, 49716, 48000, 32000, 22050, 16000, 11025, 8000.
#                         hardwarebase: base address of the real hardware soundblaster:

#                  force dsp auto-init: Treat all single-cycle DSP commands as auto-init to keep playback going.
#                                       This option is a workaround for DOS games or demos that use single-cycle DSP playback commands and
#                                       have problems with missing the Sound Blaster IRQ under load. Do not enable unless you need this workaround.
#                                       Needed for:
#                                         - Extreme "lunatic" demo (1993)
#                       force goldplay: Always render Sound Blaster output sample-at-a-time. Testing option. You probably don't want to enable this.
#                             goldplay: Enable goldplay emulation.
#                      goldplay stereo: Enable workaround for goldplay stereo playback. Many DOS demos using this technique
#                                       don't seem to know they need to double the frequency when programming the DSP time constant for Pro stereo output.
#                                       If stereo playback seems to have artifacts consider enabling this option. For accurate emulation of Sound Blaster
#                                       hardware, disable this option.
#    dsp require interrupt acknowledge: If set, the DSP will halt DMA playback until IRQ acknowledgement occurs even in auto-init mode (SB16 behavior).
#                                       If clear, IRQ acknowledgement will have no effect on auto-init playback (SB Pro and earlier & clone behavior)
#                                       If set to 'auto' then behavior is determined by sbtype= setting.
#                                       This is a setting for hardware accuracy in emulation. If audio briefly plays then stops then your DOS game
#                                       and it's not using IRQ (but using DMA), try setting this option to 'false'
#                 dsp write busy delay: Amount of time in nanoseconds the DSP chip signals 'busy' after writing to the DSP (port 2xCh). Set to -1 to use card-specific defaults.
#                                       WARNING: Setting the value too high (above 20000ns) may have detrimental effects to DOS games that use IRQ 0 and DSP command 0x10 to play audio.
#                                                Setting the value way too high (above 1000000ns) can cause significant lag in DOS games.
#         blaster environment variable: Whether or not to set the BLASTER environment variable automatically at startup
#                   sample rate limits: If set (default), limit DSP sample rate to what real hardware is limited to
#                   instant direct dac: If set, direct DAC output commands are instantaneous. This option is intended as a quick fix for
#                                       games or demos that play direct DAC music/sound from the IRQ 0 timer who a) write the DSP command
#                                       and data without polling the DSP to ensure it's ready or b) can get locked into the IRQ 0 handler
#                                       waiting for DSP status when instructed to play at or beyond the DSP's maximum direct DAC sample rate.
#                                       This fix allows broken Sound Blaster code to work and should not be enabled unless necessary.
#       stereo control with sbpro only: Default on. If set, Sound Blaster Pro stereo is not available when emulating sb16 or sb16vibra.
#                                       If clear, sb16 emulation will honor the sbpro stereo bit. Note that Creative SB16 cards do not
#                                       honor the stereo bit, and this option allows DOSBox emulate that fact. Accuracy setting.
#                  dsp busy cycle rate: Sound Blaster 16 DSP chips appear to go busy periodically at some high clock rate
#                                       whether the DSP is actually doing anything for the system or not. This is an accuracy
#                                       option for Sound Blaster emulation. If this option is nonzero, it will be interpreted
#                                       as the busy cycle rate in Hz. If zero, busy cycle will not be emulated. If -1, sound

#                  dsp busy cycle duty: If emulating SB16 busy cycle, this value (0 to 100) controls the duty cycle of the busy cycle.
#                                       If this option is set to -1, Sound Blaster emulation will choose a value automatically according

#         int13fakev86io: If set, and int13fakeio is set, certain INT 13h commands will
#                         cause floppy emulation to issue fake CPU I/O traps (GPF) in
#                         virtual 8086 mode and a fake IRQ signal. you must enable this option
#                         if you want 32-bit floppy access in Windows 95 to work with DOSBox.
#           instant mode: If set, all floppy operations are 'instantaneous', they are carried
#                         out without any delay. Real hardware of course has motor, command
#                         and data I/O delays and so this option is off by default for realistic
#                         emulation.
# auto-attach to int 13h: If set, DOSBox-X will automatically attach a disk image as being
#                         inserted into a floppy drive attached to the controller when imgmount is used
#                         to mount a disk image to drive 0/1 or A/B. If not set, you must specify
#                         the -fdc option to imgmount to attach drive A/B to the floppy controller
#                         manually. You must use the -fdc option regardless if loading floppies into
