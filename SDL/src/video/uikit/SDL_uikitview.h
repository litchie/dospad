// This is a total rewrite of original implementation.
//
// We only support 1 mouse.
//
// The trackpad behavior:
//  - pan around is translated to mouse move
//  - tap is left click
//  - tap while another finger is down is right click
//
// Also: convert pointer move events (bluetooth mouse) to mouse events.
